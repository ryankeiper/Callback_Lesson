# Callback_Lesson

Welcome to Callbacks! You will now be asked to demonstrate what you have learned.

Objectives

1. Create a new file, called callbacks.js

2. In this file, write three basic functions:

	The first function should accept a variable as an argument, and alert that variable.

	The second function should accept a variable as an argument, and console.log that variable.

	The third function should accept a variable as an argument, and return that variable.

3. Now, we will write the function that will use these three functions as callbacks:

	Write a function that accepts a CALLBACK as an argument. The function should perform some mathematical calculation, assign the result of that calculation to a variable, and then pass that variable to its callback.

4. Try calling this last function three times, with each of your three initial functions as its callback. What are the results?
